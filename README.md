### Features Left to Implement

- A future idea to implement would be a Video section where each teacher could hold on-line classes and students could login and both participate live or access old course material.

- Another future idea could be to implement an online gallery where Users could browse and purschase works of art both made by teachers and students.

## Testing 

- I have tested the site on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, both on my laptop and on my Iphone 12 Pro Max. Firefox on my laptop needed some extra work because it didnt support the

"backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);"

codes directly, I googled the issue and in a later update they will be adding this function to their browser, for now all it took was to enable it in the settings. It works fine on mobile devices without having to do anything.

- Also, the website looks good and all functions work on Ipad Pro, Iphone 12 pro Max, Iphone X and MacBook Pro 15Â´.

- Using the Devstools I can confirm this website is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes.

- The Sign Up form works properly, requieres entries in evry field and the Sign me Up button changes color when hovered.
